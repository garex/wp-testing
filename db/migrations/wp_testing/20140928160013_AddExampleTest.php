The nearer the outside of the circle you are,  the more marked are the personality traits. Please note that the EPI is a very simplistic type of personality measurement scale,  so if you have come out as a personality that does not match what you thought before you took the test,  you are probably right and the test is probably wrong!\r\n\r\n<img src=\"$pluginUrl/wp-testing/img/EPI-scales.png\" alt=\"EPI scales\" />\r\n<h2>Instructions</h2>\r\nHere are some questions regarding the way you behave,  feel and act.
